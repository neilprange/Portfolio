        The purpose of having a code of ethics for engineers is to ensure that no one is using their position or power in a way that takes advantage of others. Due to the nature of the work they must perform, many electrical and computer engineers are responsible for the safety and security of the general public. This could manifest in many different ways, from an electrical engineer designing a safe and reliable power grid, to a computer engineer designing software that protects the privacy of the user. Regardless of the work they do, most of these engineers have the ability to harm the welfare of the public, whether through purposeful ill-intent, or irresponsibility. The code of ethics is a set of rules that ensures that these engineers are doing everything they can to improve the wellbeing of the public and of each other. <br> <br>
        When I am faced with an ethical situation, I try to make a decision based on what I think is the correct thing to do. If it’s possible, I’ll try to seek advice for peers or superiors on what steps I should be taking. Some factors that I will take into consideration are whether or not I have any personal bias in the situation, whether my decision will harm other people/who it will harm, and the consequences of all my possible actions. <br><br>
        One of the ethical issues discussed in class was the Big Data Issue, in which a computer scientist is faced with the issue of whether or not to link data to a project he is working on, as the data contains personal information that he feels does not meet the minimum necessary standard for accessing personal health information. In this issue, the user is asked whether or not they think the computer scientist should use the data in their project, despite the fact that their boss wants them to. Another more common issue is the privacy associated with virtual personal assistants like Amazon Alexa. The Alexa, and other home devices, can potentially gather user data that would be considered private, and ethical considerations arise when determining whether or not to use this data in certain scenarios, criminal prosecution being one example. <br> <br>
        In general, my classmates and I agreed on the general approach to dealing with some of these ethical issues. For the big data issue, I said that the computer scientist should try to communicate with their boss the fact that including this data would likely violate the law, and thus they shouldn’t include it. The one area where I differed from my classmates slightly was on what the scientist should do if his boss still wants him to use the data. Some classmates believed that he shouldn’t use the data no matter what, but I believe that there could be a scenario where they alter how they use the data such that it does not violate any standards. We did agree however that the most ethical decision was to do everything possible to ensure the “Minimum Necessary” standard was not violated. <br> <br>
        For this ethical dilemma, one of the virtues most relevant is integrity. It would be easy for Marcus to simply include the data in his research if he lacks integrity, however his integrity is what stops him from doing the easy option. Another important virtue in this case is responsibility. Marcus has a moral obligation to not access personal health information, and without responsibility, he might not feel the need to fulfill this obligation. Lastly, honesty is important for Marcus to make the right decision. He owes it to his boss to be honest about violating any standards that he is aware of, and without having the virtue of honesty, he has no reason not to just lie to his boss about the problems with using that data.
