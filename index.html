    <p class="bio" id="bio1">
        I am a student in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University, expected to graduate in May of 2025.
        I am interested in pursuing a career in Software Development, and am looking for opportunities to grow my 
        skills in the field. 
        <br> <br>
        I have had several years of experience with OOP, with Java being my strongest langauge. I have some exposure to JavaScript
        and Python, and have worked on serveral projects in C. I have also taught myself some of the basics of HTML and CSS, through
        personal projects like this website.
