                Web Development Project in which I teamed with three other Iowa State students to build a health and fitness tracking app
                specifically for Iowa State students. As a member of the backend team, I was responsible for writing the code to manage the
                database and server, utilizing SpringBoot Java framework, and a relational MySQL databse system.

                Embedded Systems project in which I collaberated with a team of three other students in programing a microntroller to drive
                an iRobot and navigate a test field. Our program utilized mutiple sensors, including a two IR sensors and a ping sensor in 
                order to detect obstacles, map them onto a Python-based GUI, and automatically navigate around them.
