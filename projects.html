                Web Development Project in which I teamed with three other Iowa State students to build a health and fitness tracking app
                specifically for Iowa State students. As a member of the backend team, I was responsible for writing the code to manage the
                database and server, utilizing SpringBoot Java framework, and a relational MySQL databse system.

                Embedded Systems project in which I collaberated with a team of three other students in programing a microntroller to drive
                an iRobot and navigate a test field. Our program utilized mutiple sensors, including a two IR sensors and a ping sensor in 
                order to detect obstacles, map them onto a Python-based GUI, and automatically navigate around them.

                Research-based project in which I worked to increase the speed and reliability of a machine learning system running on and MSP430
                microntroller and an Igloo Nano FPGA. In this project, I was able to increase the speed of machine learning inference by
                debugging the optimizing the Tensorflow based C++ code. I was also able to debug the FPGA based hardware accelerator by fixing various
                timing and efficiency issues.
