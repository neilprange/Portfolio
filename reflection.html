    As engineers, we learn plenty about how to solve technical problems, and the necessary skills that come along with that. One thing many engineers can be missing
    is the skills to solve other types of problems that require different skills and different modes of thinking. For example, topics such as personal finance are
    important for any person to have. You can be as good of a programmer as you can, or be an expert on rockets, but that doesn't teach you how to manage your money,
    a problem that many people face. The utility of general education classes comes from the fact that they teach students a diversity of topics that they wouldn't
    normally be exposed to in their program of study. From personal investing skills, to interpersonal skills, to economics and beyond, general education classes help
    expose students to the real world by allowing them to dip their feet into deep topics that they otherwise would have no exposure to.
    <br> <br>
    Although I have had many general education courses which have helped me as an engineer beyond that technical aspects of problem solving, classes such as
    Econ 102 have provided some of the most benefit to me. Many of the principals learned in this class not only apply to economics as a whole, but also apply
    to personal economics. For example, the concept of opporutnity cost - what you are giving up in order to do something - is an important concept to understand and
    remain aware of in order to make better decision making and more effectively use your resource. Another such class is Psychology 3140 - Motivation. A class like
    this is good for teaching students not only how they can keep themselves motivated, but the pyschology surrounding motivating other. Skill learned in this class 
    can definately be applied to an engineering discipline because engineers will always have to work in teams, and so understanding how you can work better as a team 
    is essential for success.

<h1 class="title5">Cumulative Reflection</h1>

<p class="NewDescription">
    As a Computer Engineering student at Iowa State University, I have been exposed to ideas and situations that have prepared me to tackle complex engineering 
    problems I will no doubt face in the real world. Having taken a variety of different courses both relating to topics in Computer Engineering and other aspects 
    of professional life, I have been able to design solutions to complex problems using my own skill set, practiced independent learning to tackle new problems, 
    strengthened my teamwork skills by joining with peers on projects, and learned what the day to day experience is being an engineer.
    <br> <br>
    For many of the projects I have done in course work, I have found that the material provided in class alone is not enough to adequately teach how to approach 
    the problems. One concrete skill I have gained from this is the ability to read highly technical research papers and apply that knowledge to my own problems. 
    This skill is very valuable when considering how dynamic the Computer Engineering landscape is, and how important it is to be able to keep up with the latest 
    technologies and trends. Additionally, at a university you have unique access to a group of experts in any given field who are usually happy to discuss ideas. 
    Leveraging professors to help solve problems or learn about complex concepts has taught me the value of asking for help when I am struggling.
    <br> <br>
    Outside the classroom, I have found that Undergraduate Research Experience has been vital for me in learning how many of the classroom concepts can be applied 
    to real world problems. During my time as an REU at Duwe Group, I was able to see what it is like to work on a project that, unlike classroom projects, had not 
    been done before. This problem exploration gave me a working understanding of many of the technical and non technical skills that you don’t always learn in the 
    classroom, such as finding the right problem to work on, independent research and documentation, and self-teaching. An experience like that also instilled a 
    confidence in my own abilities as an engineer, teaching me that if I put in the time and effort, I can do things that have not been done before.
    <br> <br>
    Looking back at my college experience, there are many things that I could have done better. I know now that college courses alone are not enough to teach you the 
    skills necessary to be successful in your field, even if you have a high GPA. Looking back at my freshman and sophomore year, I could have sought other opportunities 
    to get experience, such as working on personal projects and joining clubs that worked on technical problems. Additionally, I would have gave more thought into the 
    specific path I would like to go down, as that could have led me into more relevant coursework and steered my career better.

<h1 class="title5">Ethics Essay</h1>

<p class="NewDescription">
	The purpose of having a code of ethics for engineers is to ensure that no one is using their position or power in a way that takes advantage of others. Due to the nature of the work they must perform, many electrical and computer engineers are responsible for the safety and security of the general public. This could manifest in many different ways, from an electrical engineer designing a safe and reliable power grid, to a computer engineer designing software that protects the privacy of the user. Regardless of the work they do, most of these engineers have the ability to harm the welfare of the public, whether through purposeful ill-intent, or irresponsibility. The code of ethics is a set of rules that ensures that these engineers are doing everything they can to improve the wellbeing of the public and of each other.
    <br> <br>
	When I am faced with an ethical situation, I try to make a decision based on what I think is the correct thing to do. If it’s possible, I’ll try to seek advice for peers or superiors on what steps I should be taking. Some factors that I will take into consideration are whether or not I have any personal bias in the situation, whether my decision will harm other people/who it will harm, and the consequences of all my possible actions. 
    <br> <br>
    One of the ethical issues discussed in class was the Big Data Issue, in which a computer scientist is faced with the issue of whether or not to link data to a project he is working on, as the data contains personal information that he feels does not meet the minimum necessary standard for accessing personal health information. In this issue, the user is asked whether or not they think the computer scientist should use the data in their project, despite the fact that their boss wants them to. Another more common issue is the privacy associated with virtual personal assistants like Amazon Alexa. The Alexa, and other home devices, can potentially gather user data that would be considered private, and ethical considerations arise when determining whether or not to use this data in certain scenarios, criminal prosecution being one example. 
    <br> <br>
    In general, my classmates and I agreed on the general approach to dealing with some of these ethical issues. For the big data issue, I said that the computer scientist should try to communicate with their boss the fact that including this data would likely violate the law, and thus they shouldn’t include it. The one area where I differed from my classmates slightly was on what the scientist should do if his boss still wants him to use the data. Some classmates believed that he shouldn’t use the data no matter what, but I believe that there could be a scenario where they alter how they use the data such that it does not violate any standards. We did agree however that the most ethical decision was to do everything possible to ensure the “Minimum Necessary” standard was not violated.
    <br> <br>
    For this ethical dilemma, one of the virtues most relevant is integrity. It would be easy for Marcus to simply include the data in his research if he lacks integrity, however his integrity is what stops him from doing the easy option. Another important virtue in this case is responsibility. Marcus has a moral obligation to not access personal health information, and without responsibility, he might not feel the need to fulfill this obligation. Lastly, honesty is important for Marcus to make the right decision. He owes it to his boss to be honest about violating any standards that he is aware of, and without having the virtue of honesty, he has no reason not to just lie to his boss about the problems with using that data.
