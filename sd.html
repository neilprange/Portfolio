    <p class="NewDescription">
        In this project, my team an I were tasked with creating an embedded device capable of detecting PTSD symptoms and communicating data of an impending PTSD attack
        to a haptic vibration device worn by a service dog to provide comfort to the veteran. This deivce utiliizes a photoplethysmogram (PPG) and accelerometer to 
        determine measure patient vital signs, and communicated over bluetooth to a dog-worn vest when heart rate and movement data suggest comfort is needed.
        <br> <br>
        My role within this project has been to program the PPG sensor to read RAW IR values from a patients wrist, and write algorithms to determine if this data
        indicates the patient is suffering a PTSD attack. Through this work, I have learned valuable embedded systems fundmanetals, including I2S protocol for gathering data,
        analog to digital conversion, hardware fundmentals such as reading circuit diagrams, and strengthened my embedded C skills.
        <br> <br>
        Becuase we are still in the earlier stages of our project, we do not have a link to our project resources that is publicly available (yet). The big picture of this
        project, however, is to better enable fast and realiable detection of PTSD episodes while also strengthening our teamwork and leadership skills while working on a
        complicated technical project.
